Hashing:
- Create other hashable/better objects?

Other:
- Take notes on python typing
- Remember to use TypeGuard if needed
- add in functions for progressbars in and out of notebooks
- multiprocessing progress pool?
- allow hash_object to return int as well as string (return_type=str, can be int, str, 'int', 'str', etc.)
- add in hash_obj alias
- add in a strictly_equal() that cares about exact types and whatnot?
- multiprocessing threadpool things and map_with_progress
- Make easier subprocessing with better guards for dealing with stdin/out and very large inputs/outputs
- scripting system that can execute multiple bash lines in parallel, await finish, run others, wait for time, ssh into other machines to start things, etc.
- make thing that can search through set of machines calling nvidia-smi to get open machines
- munge inputs module with:
    - check strings
    - mutually exclusive inputs
- multi-layer progress bars
    
    
Confusion matrix:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

conf_mat, labels = None, None

conf_mat = conf_mat / conf_mat.sum(axis=0)
conf_mat = conf_mat / conf_mat.sum(axis=1)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(conf_mat, display_labels=labels)
disp.plot()

plt.title('Title')
plt.show()
